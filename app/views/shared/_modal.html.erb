                                        2.7  curtain release

                                        Curtains frequently develop tender areas while hanging as a result of heat, sunlight, humidity and air pollution. Consequently, despite utmost care exercised in our cleaning process, holes or tears in the fabric may occur. Faded areas may not be apparent because of doll converge. Progressive shrinkage may occur because of the inherent nature of the fabric or because it was not completely preshrunk. For these reasons, we accept your curtains for cleaning subject to your no-fault agreement.

                                        By place curtain cleaning order with KwikIron, you have read the above and agree to holdKwikIron blameless in event any of the following conditions become evident or occur in cleaning my curtains: sun fade, color loss due to non-fast colors, holes or tears due to fabric degradation, shrinkage.
